This is  a quick tutorial repo for Deborah Good's Smith interview teaching talk. 

The enivronment.yml will let you make a conda env that includes all the required packages to run the notebook.

run:
conda env create -f environment.yml -n gp-tutorial
conda activate myenv


The original_celerite_tutorial.ipynb will be what we use in the demo but is also literally just the modeling tutorial from the docs.
